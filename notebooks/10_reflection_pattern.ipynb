       "Great implementation of Merge Sort! Here's my feedback:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Overall structure and organization**: Your code is well-organized, and the separation of the `merge_sort` and `merge` functions is correct. The docstrings are also helpful in explaining the purpose and behavior of each function.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Code quality and style**: Your code adheres to PEP 8 conventions, which is great. The variable names are descriptive, and the code is easy to read.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Performance**: Your implementation has the correct time and space complexity for Merge Sort, which is O(n log n) and O(n), respectively.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Minor suggestions**:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Consistent spacing**: In the `merge` function, there's an extra space between the `while` loop and the `result.extend` statements. Remove the extra space for consistency.\n",
       "2. **In-line comments**: You could add in-line comments to explain the logic behind specific lines of code, especially in the `merge` function. For example, you could add a comment above the `while` loop explaining that it's merging the two sorted arrays.\n",
       "3. **Type hints**: Consider adding type hints for the function parameters and return types to make the code more readable and self-documenting.\n",
       "4. **Testing**: While you provided an example usage, it would be great to include more test cases to ensure the implementation is correct. You could add a test function that verifies the sorted array is correct for different input cases.\n",
