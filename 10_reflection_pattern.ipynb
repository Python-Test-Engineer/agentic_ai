       "Thank you for sharing your implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm! Overall, your code looks clean, well-structured, and easy to understand. Here are some critiques and recommendations to help improve your code:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Docstring formatting:** Your docstrings are well-written, but they could be formatted better. In Python, it's common to use the triple quotes `\"\"\"...\"\"\"` for multi-line docstrings. You can also use the `numpy` style docstring format, which is widely adopted in the Python community.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendation:** Update your docstrings to use the `numpy` style formatting. For example:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def merge_sort(arr):\n",
       "    \"\"\"\n",
       "    Sorts an array of elements using the Merge Sort algorithm.\n",
       "\n",
       "    Parameters\n",
       "    ----------\n",
       "    arr : list\n",
       "        The array to be sorted\n",
       "\n",
       "    Returns\n",
       "    -------\n",
       "    list\n",
       "        The sorted array\n",
       "    \"\"\"\n",
       "    ...\n",
       "```\n",
       "**2. Type hints:** You've done a great job documenting the function parameters and return types, but you can take it a step further by adding type hints. This will make your code more readable and self-documenting.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendation:** Add type hints for function parameters and return types. For example:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def merge_sort(arr: list) -> list:\n",
       "    ...\n",
       "```\n",
       "**3. Consistent naming conventions:** Your code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable names. It's essential to stick to a consistent naming convention throughout your code.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendation:** Use underscore notation for variable names, as it's the conventional style in Python.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Redundant comments:** Some of your comments, such as `# The merge_sort function takes an array as input and recursively divides it into two halves until each half has only one element.` are redundant, as they simply restate what the code already does.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendation:** Remove redundant comments and focus on comments that provide additional context or explain complex logic.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Error handling:** Your implementation assumes that the input array only contains comparable elements. However, if the input array contains non-comparable elements (e.g., strings and integers), your code will raise a `TypeError`.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendation:** Consider adding input validation to handle such cases. You can raise a `ValueError` or return an error message if the input array contains non-comparable elements.\n",
       "\n",
       "**6. Testing:** While you've provided an example of how to test the implementation, it's essential to write more comprehensive tests to ensure your code works correctly for various input scenarios.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendation:** Write additional tests to cover edge cases, such as an empty input array, an array with a single element, or an array with duplicate elements.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, your implementation is well-structured, and with these recommendations, you can make it even more robust and readable. Keep up the good work!"
