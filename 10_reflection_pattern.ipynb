       "**Docstrings and Comments**:\n",
       "\n",
       "Your docstrings and comments are excellent, making the code very readable and understandable. However, I'd suggest adding a brief explanation of the Merge Sort algorithm in the `merge_sort` docstring, similar to what you've done in the code explanation section. This would make the code more self-contained and helpful for others who might not be familiar with the algorithm.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Code Consistency**:\n",
       "\n",
       "In the `merge_sort` function, you've used both single quotes and double quotes for string literals. While both are valid in Python, it's generally a good practice to stick to a single convention throughout the code. In this case, you've used double quotes for the docstring, so it's consistent to use double quotes for the other string literals as well.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Naming Conventions**:\n",
       "\n",
       "Your variable names are clear and descriptive, but it's worth noting that PEP 8 recommends using underscores to separate words in variable names (e.g., `left_half` instead of `left`). This is a minor point, but it can improve code readability.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Performance Consideration**:\n",
       "\n",
       "In the `merge` function, you're using the `pop(0)` method to remove and return the first element of the `left` and `right` lists. While this works correctly, it's not the most efficient approach, as `pop(0)` has a time complexity of O(n) in Python. A more efficient approach would be to use indexing and slicing to extract the elements from the lists, like this:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def merge(left, right):\n",
       "    result = []\n",
       "    while len(left) > 0 and len(right) > 0:\n",

       "            result.append(left[0])\n",

       "    result.extend(right)\n",
       "    return result\n",
       "```\n",
       "This change reduces the time complexity of the `merge` function, making the overall Merge Sort algorithm more efficient.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Testing**:\n",
       "\n",
       "Your example test case is a good start, but it's always a good idea to include more test cases to ensure the implementation is correct for different input scenarios. Consider adding test cases for:\n",
       "\n",
       "* An empty array `[]`\n",
       "* A single-element array `[5]`\n",
       "* A pre-sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n",

       "* An array with duplicate elements `[2, 2, 4, 1, 3]`\n",

      "### Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "The `merge_sort` function takes an array as input and recursively splits it into two halves until each subarray contains only one element. The `merge` function takes two sorted arrays and merges them back together in a sorted manner. The `merge_sort` function uses the `merge` function to merge the sorted halves back together.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Time Complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the algorithm recursively splits the array in half until each subarray contains only one element, resulting in a total of log n levels. At each level, the algorithm merges the subarrays back together, resulting in a total of n operations. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n log n).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Space Complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "The space complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the algorithm creates temporary arrays to store the merged subarrays. The maximum amount of extra space required is equal to the size of the input array.\n",

      "REFLECTION\n",
      "\n",
      " **Critique and Recommendations**\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the implementation of the merge sort algorithm is correct and well-structured. However, here are a few suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Error Handling**: The implementation does not handle edge cases such as an empty input array or a non-list input. Consider adding checks at the beginning of the `merge_sort` function to raise an error or return a default value for these cases.\n",
      "2. **Type Hints**: Python supports type hints for function arguments and return values. Consider adding type hints to the `merge_sort` and `merge` functions to improve readability and usability.\n",
      "3. **Docstrings**: The implementation includes docstrings for the functions, but they could be more detailed. Consider adding more information about the function's behavior, such as any preconditions or postconditions.\n",
      "4. **Testing**: The implementation includes an example usage, but it would be beneficial to include more comprehensive unit tests to ensure the correctness of the algorithm.\n",
      "5. **Redundant Comments**: Some of the comments in the code are redundant and don't provide additional information. Consider removing these comments to improve readability.\n",

      "\n",
      "Your refactored code is well-structured and follows best practices for software development. Here are some additional observations and suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Code Quality:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Your use of type hints and docstrings is excellent. It improves the readability and maintainability of the code.\n",
      "*   The exception handling is well-implemented, providing helpful error messages.\n",
      "*   The unit tests cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the code works as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Code Structure:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The separation of concerns between the `merge_sort` and `merge` functions is good. Each function has a clear responsibility.\n",
      "*   The code is well-organized, with logical groupings of related functions and tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Testing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Your tests cover various edge cases, including empty arrays, arrays with duplicates, and arrays with negative numbers.\n",
      "*   Consider adding tests for very large arrays to ensure the implementation is efficient and scalable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Naming and Comments:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Your variable names and function names are descriptive and follow Python conventions.\n",
      "*   The comments are mostly removed, but the code is self-explanatory. If you need to add comments, they should be concise and focused on explaining the \"why\" rather than the \"what.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Suggestions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Consider adding a `main` function to demonstrate how to use the `merge_sort` function. This would provide a clear example for users.\n",
      "*   If you plan to use this implementation in a production environment, consider adding additional validation for non-integer values in the input array.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Code Readability and Maintainability:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The code is well-organized and easy to read.\n",
      "*   The use of blank lines and consistent indentation improves the code's visual appeal.\n",
